# Automatic log file redirection for build scripts
#
# Source this at the top of build scripts to redirect all output to a log file.
# Uses self-re-exec pattern: the script re-launches itself with external redirection,
# which reliably captures ALL output including docker compose TTY output.
#
# Detection logic:
# - If KICAD_LOG_NESTED=1 (re-exec'd or nested call) → output normally
# - If inside Docker (/workspace exists) → output normally
# - Otherwise → re-exec with output redirected to logs/<script>/<timestamp>.log

# Skip if already logging (re-exec'd or nested call)
if [[ "${KICAD_LOG_NESTED:-0}" == "1" ]]; then
    return 0 2>/dev/null || exit 0
fi

# Skip if inside Docker container
if [[ -d "/workspace" ]]; then
    return 0 2>/dev/null || exit 0
