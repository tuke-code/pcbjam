# Build the host post-process Binaryen tools from our submodule: wasm-opt (with the
# catch-arm-hoisting pass, --hoist-cpp-catches) AND wasm-emscripten-finalize.
#
# Source of truth is the tracked Binaryen submodule (binaryen/, branch wasm-port =
# upstream version_130 + src/passes/HoistCppCatches.cpp). This configures an out-of-source
# build into the gitignored build-wasm/ tree and prints the wasm-opt path on stdout
# (build progress to stderr); wasm-emscripten-finalize lands next to it in the same bin/
# (apply-finalize.sh derives it from the wasm-opt dir). Building both from one submodule
# keeps finalize and asyncify on a single Binaryen version and removes the host emsdk
# dependency from the post-process. See docs/features/wasm-exceptions/06-spike-plan.md (Phase 1.5).

# cmake+ninja. Trust only if both tools actually RUN: the binaries dynamically link
# lib/libbinaryen.so, so an existence check alone passes on an incomplete restore
# (bin/ without lib/ shipped a red main, run 28585074335) while --version proves the
# loader resolves everything. Never set the var locally when iterating on the pass:
# uncommitted source edits would be silently ignored (the SHA key can't see them).
