# Build a KiCad app (pcbnew, eeschema, calculator) inside Docker, then run
# asyncify and friends on the host.
#
# Usage:
#   ./docker/build.sh <app>[,<app>...] [args...]
#
# Apps:
#   kicad_editor   merged PCB + schematic editor image — serves all four editors
#                  (PCB / Footprint / Schematic / Symbol) via runtime --frame
#   calculator     PCB calculator
#   pl_editor      drawing-sheet editor
#   gerbview       Gerber viewer
#   all            build all of the above
#   pcbnew         standalone PCB engine (debug aid; not deployed — kicad_editor is)
#   eeschema       standalone schematic engine (debug aid; not deployed)
#
# A comma-separated list builds just those apps in order (e.g.
# "calculator,pl_editor" — used to exercise the multi-app pipeline cheaply).
#
# Any extra args are forwarded to scripts/kicad/build-<app>.sh (e.g. -j 8,
# --full, --release, --diag=gal).
#
# The build is split into two phases:
# 1. Docker: Compile KiCad to WASM (without asyncify)
# 2. Host: dyncall shims + finalize + asyncify + wasm-opt -O1 (Binaryen submodule via build-wasm-opt.sh)
#
# KICAD_PIPELINE=1 (multi-app builds only): run phase 2 of each app in the
# background while the next app compiles in the container. wasm-opt is
# Amdahl-capped at ~4 effective cores, so on a many-core CI box the container
# would otherwise sit idle for the 1-2h of host-side wasm-opt (run 27226030304:
# 103 min of the 4h was tools serialized behind each other's wasm-opt). At most
# KICAD_PIPELINE_JOBS (default 2) postprocesses run concurrently — pcbnew's wasm-opt
# pass peaks ~34 GB RSS, so 2 fits the 128 GB CI box but NOT a dev Mac: leave
# KICAD_PIPELINE unset locally.
#
# Binaryen is downloaded automatically - no prerequisites needed.

# Auto-launch the live progress dashboard in this terminal (handled by logging.sh,
# which owns the TTY before it re-execs us with output redirected). Set KICAD_NO_MONITOR=1
# to disable. MUST be set before sourcing logging.sh — that's where the dashboard is
# launched, in the pre-re-exec process.
