// Resolve the static-server port for this run.
//
// This config file is re-imported by EVERY Playwright process: the main runner
// (which launches the webServer) and each worker process (which calls
// page.goto(baseURL)). They must all agree on one port. Playwright also
// *recreates* a worker mid-run after a test times out or crashes — and that new
// worker re-imports this config.
//
// The previous heuristic ("reuse .test-port if it's <60s old, else pick a new
// free port") broke exactly there: once a run passed the 60s mark, a recreated
// worker treated the file as stale, picked a DIFFERENT free port, and every
// subsequent page.goto hit a dead port (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) because the
// webServer was still listening on the original port. A single failing test
// thus cascaded into ~all later tests failing.
//
// Fix (same as playwright-kicad.config.ts): drop the time window entirely. The
// main runner always picks a fresh port and writes it; workers always reuse
// whatever the main runner wrote. The main runner is the only process whose
// argv carries the `test` command (workers are forked with an empty argv), and
// it imports this config — and so writes the file — before any worker is
// spawned.
