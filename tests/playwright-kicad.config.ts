// NOTE: Chrome headless crashes on ARM Mac due to SwiftShader WebGL bug
// (Chromium issues #1416283, #338414704). Firefox headless works reliably.
// Use --project=firefox for headless, --project=chromium for headed debugging.

// Resolve the static-server port for this run.
//
// This config file is re-imported by EVERY Playwright process: the main runner
// (which launches the webServer) and each worker process (which calls
// page.goto(baseURL)). They must all agree on one port. Playwright also
// *recreates* a worker mid-run after a test times out or crashes — and that new
// worker re-imports this config.
//
// The previous heuristic ("reuse .test-port if it's <60s old, else pick a new
// free port") broke exactly there: once a run passed the 60s mark, a recreated
// worker treated the file as stale, picked a DIFFERENT free port, and every
// subsequent page.goto hit a dead port (NS_ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) because the
// webServer was still listening on the original port. A single timing-out test
// (e.g. eeschema-load) thus cascaded into ~all later tests failing.
//
// Fix: drop the time window entirely. The main runner always picks a fresh port
// and writes it; workers always reuse whatever the main runner wrote. The main
// runner is the only process whose argv carries the `test` command (workers are
// forked with an empty argv), and it imports this config — and so writes the
// file — before any worker is spawned.
