/**
 * Regression for the camera-move-on-canvas raytrace DEADLOCK.
 *
 * The 3D viewer's EDA_3D_CANVAS is a wxGLCanvas whose paint runs the multi-threaded CPU
 * raytracer. Moving the camera makes the raytracer spawn raw std::thread workers; with no
 * PROXY_TO_PTHREAD its join runs on the browser main thread, and KiCad's own thread pool has
 * already drained emscripten's pre-warmed Worker pool — so those threads fall back to on-demand
 * `new Worker()`, whose boot handshake needs the main thread back in the JS event loop, which it
 * can't reach while blocked in the render's busy-wait join. That circular wait is the freeze the
 * user hit ("move the model → tab freezes"). The fix pre-warms PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE =
 * hardwareConcurrency*2+8 for 3D-viewer builds (scripts/kicad/build-kicad-target.sh) so on-demand
 * creation never happens; a wxwidgets wasm-layer change (src/wasm/app.cpp) additionally defers the
 * 3D viewer's synchronous mouse-button Paint to the yielding pump (jank + defense, mirroring the
 * resize-deadlock fix).
 *
 * Drives the REAL viewer with two camera-rotate drags (mirroring "move the model … move it
 * again"), each followed by a settle for the raytrace to converge, asserting after every step that
 * (a) the wasm main thread stays responsive (a deadlock hangs it) and (b) nothing aborted. Pre-fix
 * a camera drag freezes or aborts; post-fix both stay live and the board keeps rendering. Frame
 * drag/resize of the viewer are covered by 3d-viewer.spec.ts.
 *
 * ISOLATED in its own spec file (own Playwright worker → own browser process → a SINGLE heavy
 * pcbnew load). The pre-warmed pool is ~2x hardwareConcurrency Workers PER load; running several
 * 3D-viewer loads in one process (a serial describe) accumulates enough Workers that a later
 * load's pool is short and the raytracer deadlocks anyway — so this test must not share a worker
 * with the other 3D-viewer tests.
 *
 * Notes: the glcanvas client area is pointer-events:none, so a page.mouse drag over it falls
 * through to the main #canvas whose Emscripten mousedown/up callback dispatches into
 * wxApp::HandleMouseEvent — the deadlock path. WebGL pixels are read via drawImage→2D→getImageData
 * (preserveDrawingBuffer=true), since a CDP screenshot of a WebGL canvas is blank on swiftshader.
