The goal is to build kicad with wasm and run it in a browser
README.md details how to run the project

A lot of native module have to be compiled to wasm, the most complex is wxwidgets
/kicad and /wxwidgets are git submodules from our own forks
The e2e tests are in /tests, with a README and WHATWORKS md files
The e2e tests are separated per feature
Wxwidgets wasm port has hooks for finding positions of UI elements, tests use that
The test have screenshots that are tracked with git, use compare-screenshots.sh to see what changed
Update test images with /scripts/update-baseline-screenshots.sh when a new image is added
The tests have log files in tests/logs/{wxwidgets/kicad}/{test-name} after each run where the js console and cpp logs are visible
Always check screenshots for validating tests

Build wxwidgets with scripts/build-wxuniversal-wasm.sh
Build kicad with docker/build.sh
Build CPP wxwidgets tests with scripts/builds-wasm-test.sh
The build scripts pipe their outputs into log files so that they won't clog the LLM context. 
Don't pipe outputs, just run the scripts. Maybe with flex if you need that.

Don't change the wxwidgets core unless absolutely necessary, try to fix things in the wasm layer.
Don't change kicad unless absolutely necessary - keep our fork as close to upstream as possible.
Run scripts/kicad-diff-stats.sh to see how far our KiCad fork has diverged from upstream.
It's okay to add temporary logging that will be removed for debugging.

Don't try to guess what's broken , use debug tools / symbols, supported by the build scripts
