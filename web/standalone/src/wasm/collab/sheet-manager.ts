/**
 * Warm-pool multi-room collab manager for hierarchical schematics (subschemas).
 *
 * A hierarchical design references several `.kicad_sch` files; each is its own collab
 * room. This manager keeps EVERY discovered sheet's Y.Doc + provider connected for the
 * whole session (the "warm pool"), so the doc stays current over its open WebSocket
 * even when that sheet isn't on screen and switching sheets needs no reconnect.
 *
 * The C++ items bridge (`window.kicadCollab.onItems` / `kicadCollabApplyItems` /
 * `kicadCollabSnapshotItems`) is a SINGLETON tied to the editor's active screen, so at
 * most ONE room may be bound to the editor at a time. Navigation (the C++
 * `onSheetChanged` hook → {@link SheetCollabManager.switchTo}) re-routes that single
 * binding between already-warm docs; it does not tear down providers. The Phase-0 C++
 * change scopes the snapshot/diff to the active screen, so each room carries exactly its
 * own sheet's items and per-sheet seed/adopt is correct.
 *
 * Background sheets stay synced at the DATA layer (their doc accumulates remote edits)
 * but are not reflected in the editor's other-sheet view until you navigate in — at
 * which point the doc is already warm, so the merge into view is instant. Fully live
 * non-active-sheet VIEW updates would need a sheet-targeted C++ apply (a future upgrade
 * this design leaves open). Presence (per-room awareness) is likewise additive.
